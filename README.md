# OpenBills

OpenBills is a very simple browser based invoicing software hosted locally and meant for use with standalone computers. 
It's ideal for small businesses and is meant to be customizable and easy to use. 
So everyone from a computer newbie and a power user can benifit from it.

The front end is written in react.js and back end is written in Go. 
The backend is a single executable that you run to start the app and then use the app in the browser by going to localhost:8080
