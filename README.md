# OpenBills

OpenBills is a very simple browser based invoicing software hosted locally and meant for use with standalone computers. 
It's ideal for small businesses and is meant to be customizable and easy to use. 
So everyone from a computer newbie to a power user can benifit from it.

The front end is written in react.js and back end is written in Go. 
The backend is (supposed to be) a single executable that you run to start the app and then use the app in the browser by going to localhost:8080

## This project is highly under development and is being written by a newbie.

Please consider contributing new features or optimizations.

To contribute, fork the project, add your feature and issue a pull request. It's that simple! apparently


## A summary of the features I want to implement

(not all of the features are here I've written them down and am too lazy to type it out)

1. Being able to save product and customer data so no need to type it all out all the time

2. Password protect the app

3. Support for multiple users with their own or optionally shared settings and data among a group of users

4. Support for rendering a styled invoice document and options to export or print it

5. Many other things that I'll add hopefully
